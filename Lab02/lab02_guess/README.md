# Lab02 - Challenge Exercise - Guess

Open `guess.py`.

Write a program in `guess.py` that asks the user to think of a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and then repeatedly guesses a number, and gets the user to say whether the guess loo low, too high or correct. Example:

```bash
Pick a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
My guess is: 50
Is my guess too low (L), too high (H), or correct (C)?
L
My guess is: 75
Is my guess too low (L), too high (H), or correct (C)?
H
My guess is: 62
Is my guess too low (L), too high (H), or correct (C)?
C
Got it!
```

This program had the following standard input passed to it
```bash
