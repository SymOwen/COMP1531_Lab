# Lab02 - Exercise - List

Open `list_exercises.py`.

## Step 1

Implement the function stubs using only one line of python.

Some basic tests have been added in `test_list_exercises.py`. Run these tests with `pytest` to ensure they pass.

## Step 2

Now, in `test_list_exercises.py` add more to each test to make the test suite more exhaustive. Try to add more tests with more assert statements. Consider what behaviour is not being tested.

## Final Step

Commit and push your code to the master branch of this repository. The code on your master branch on gitlab is what will be submitted at the deadline. The pipeline for this repo will run `pytest`, so use it to check you've implemented everything.
