## Lab04 - Exercise - Requirements

A client has come to you asking "I really need you to build me a new system to help students see how many available seats there are on campus."

Pair up with someone in your lab (probably one of your group members), and have either of you occupy one of two roles:
 * One of you pretends to be the client, answering questions that the engineer has
 * One of you pretends to be the engineer, and engages in a process of requirements elicitation from the client.

Document a conversation (you could do it on an online tool then copy it across after, for example) between you where the engineer leads a process of requirements elicitation to understand the scope and requirements associated with this project.
