Look at `encapsulate.py`. There are design imperfections with this code. relating to encapsulation (in terms of the class), and something to do with how age is calculated being rigid (in terms of it only works for 2019, and will break this year). Improve the design of this code, and add a short comment or two up the top explaining what you've done and why.

The code is currently pylint compliant. Ensure it remains that way.
